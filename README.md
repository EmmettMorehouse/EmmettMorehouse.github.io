# Portfolio
My first portfolio. Built using only the basics: html, css, and javascript. Available on GitHub Pages (https://EmmettMorehouse.github.io)

I am currently self-teaching web development using Codecademy as I was unable to take a true web development course while obtaining my BS Computer Science.

Under work until this line is removed.
